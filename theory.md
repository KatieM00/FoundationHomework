   Before committing, you must stage the changes you want to include in the commit. You use `git add` to add specific files or, to add all modified files,`git add --all` or `git add _`.
2. **Commit Message**:
    
    A brief description that summarises the changes made in the commit. It is important to provide a meaningful and descriptive commit message to document the purpose or intention behind the changes. The *commit* message is entered along with the `git commit` command using the `-m` option.
